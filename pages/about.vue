    <h2>About Rock Climbing</h2>
    <p>
      Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
      formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
      While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use
      climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and
      to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from
      falls.
